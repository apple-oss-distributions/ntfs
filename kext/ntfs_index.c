 * operation such as an index entry addition requiring one or more index block
 * splits for example.
 *
 * If the @key is found in the index, 0 is returned and *@index_ctx is set up
 * to describe the index entry containing the matching @key.  The matching
 * entry is pointed to by *@index_ctx->entry.
 *
 * If the @key is not found in the index, ENOENT is returned and *@index_ctx is

 * with a key of @key would need to be inserted.

 * If an error occurs return the error code.  In this case *@index_ctx is
 * undefined and must be freed via a call to ntfs_index_ctx_put() or
 * reinitialized via a call to ntfs_index_ctx_put_reuse().
 *
 * When finished with the entry and its data, call ntfs_index_ctx_put() to free
 * the context and other associated resources.
 *
 * If the index entry was modified, call ntfs_index_entry_mark_dirty() before

 * adding an entry (@add is true) or for removing an entry (@del is true) or if
 * it is a simple lookup (read-only or overwrite without change in length, both
 * @add and @del are false).  For the lookup case we do not need to record the

 * time we descend into a sub-node.  Alternatively take a single parameter
 * @reason or @intent or something and define some constants like NTFS_LOOKUP,
 * NTFS_ADD, and NTFS_DEL or something to go with it to serve the same purpose

 * allocation attribute and then shrink the index root attribute.  However,
 * there is not enough space in the mft record to do this.  Also we already
 * have the index root attribute looked up so it makes sense to deal with it
 * first.
 *
 * Thus, if there is no index allocation attribute, we allocate the space to be
 * used by the index allocation attribute and setup the directory inode for a
 * large index including the allocated space but leaving the initialized size
 * to zero.  We then map and lock the first page containing the now allocated
 * first index block and move the index entries from the index root into it.
 * We then shrink the index root and set it up to point to the allocated index
 * block.
 *
 * Having shrunk the index root attribute there is now hopefully enough space
 * in the mft record to create the index allocation attribute and the index
 * bitmap attribute in the mft record and the conversion is complete.
 *
 * If there is not enough space we create the index allocation and/or index
 * bitmap attributes in an extent mft record.  TODO: This is not implemented

	 * We have to replace it with its predecessor (which by definition is a
	 * leaf entry).  There are three cases of increasing complexity:
	 *
	 * 1) The simplest case is when the predecessor is not the only entry
	 * in its (leaf) node thus it can be simply removed without any tree
	 * rebalancing needing to be done on its node and in addition the
	 * predecessor entry can replace the entry to be deleted without
	 * overflowing the node, i.e. there is enough space in the node we are
	 * deleting the entry from to fit its predecessor entry thus it is a
	 * matter of a simple replace without the need to change anything else
	 * in the tree.
	 *
	 * 2) The slightly more complicated case is the same as above case 1)
	 * except that there is not enough space in the node the entry to be
	 * deleted is in to fit its predecessor entry, thus we need to split
	 * the node the entry is being deleted from and promote the median
	 * entry to the parent node which may then overflow the parent node and
	 * so on up to the root node.  A particular annoyance here is that
	 * depending on the implementation details it is possible for the entry
	 * to be deleted to be the median entry and thus be promoted to its
	 * parent or alternatively it is possible for its predecessor entry
	 * that is to replace the entry to be deleted to have to be promoted.
	 * A further pitfall is that if the entry to be deleted is behind the
	 * median entry, i.e. it is on the right of the median entry, then it
	 * will be moved to a different node (the new right-hand node to the
	 * old node being split) thus the replace needs to happen in a
	 * different place.  If we use ntfs_index_entry_add() as it is to take
	 * care of the split&promote on insertion this last case would cause us
	 * the problem that the pointers would be all out of date.  We would
	 * need ntfs_index_entry_add() to update the pointers and to switch the
	 * right and left nodes in that case.  Perhaps we need an
	 * ntfs_index_entry_replace() that can share a lot of code with
	 * ntfs_index_entry_add() perhaps even just a flag to
	 * ntfs_index_entry_add() to indicate replace?  Then we would not need
	 * to worry about the pointers becoming out of date as the replace
	 * would be done already for us.
	 *
	 * 3) The more complicated case is when the predecessor entry is the
	 * last entry in its (leaf) node thus we cannot use it to replace the
	 * entry to be deleted without rebalancing the tree.  In this case we
	 * have to rebalance the tree so that the predecessor entry is no
	 * longer the last entry in its (leaf) node.  Once that is successfully
	 * done we have reduced the problem to either case 1) or case 2) above
	 * or in fact to a completely different case (see below).  The benefit
	 * of doing the rebalancing first without regard to the delete and
	 * replace that are to take place is that the tree ends up in a
	 * consistent state, just a different one to what it was before, thus
	 * we do not need to rollback to the original state any more thus error
	 * handling is greatly simplified.  The pitfall here is that doing the
	 * balancing may profoundly change the tree to the extent that the
	 * entry to be deleted may be moved to somewhere completely different
	 * which we somehow need to be able to cope with.  This can have
	 * positive side effects, too, as it for example can lead to the entry
	 * to be deleted being turned into a leaf entry thus its deletion turns
	 * into a delete of a leaf entry thus the planned replace does not need
	 * to happen at all.  This is the "completely different case" mentioned
	 * above.  Usually this case will have been caused by a merge of two
	 * neighbouring nodes with pulldown of the parent entry (which happens
	 * to be the entry to be deleted) thus the entry to be deleted will not
	 * only be a leaf entry but it will also not be the last entry in the
	 * leaf node thus it can be deleted with a simple delete.  Otherwise it
	 * is not a disaster and we just need to rebalance the tree again as we
	 * did just now but this time making sure that the entry to be deleted
	 * is not the only entry in the node (compare to above where we were
	 * making sure that the leaf predecessor entry is not the only entry in
	 * its leaf node) and then we can proceed with a simple delete of the
	 * leaf node.  Because the tree is balanced at all steps we do not
	 * actually care about handling the delete of the entry in the case
	 * that it turned into a leaf entry and we just leave it to the leaf
	 * entry deletion code to deal with.
	 *
	 * That is quite enough description now, let the games begin.  First,
	 * investigate the index entry to be deleted and its predecessor to
	 * determine which of the above categories the deletion falls into.
	 *
	 * Locate the predecessor entry.  Because the predecessor may be the
	 * only entry in its (leaf) node in which case it would cause the tree
	 * to be rebalanced, we record the path taken to the predecessor entry
	 * by simply extending the existing tree path that points to the entry

	 * To do this we ascend the tree looking for a node with entries in it.
	 * The first node containing any entries is the node containing the
	 * predecessor entry (which is not a leaf entry).
	 *
	 * 1) If we reach the original node containing the entry to be deleted
	 * without finding any non-empty nodes on the way the whole sub-tree
	 * below the entry to be deleted will become empty after using the
	 * predecessor leaf entry to replace the entry to be deleted.  Thus we

	 * the entry to be deleted we remove it altogether and we then move the
	 * predecessor leaf entry that is now homeless in front of its new
	 * successor leaf entry, thus effectively merging the node containing
	 * the predecessor with its right-hand sibling.
	 *
	 * Note that the insertion of the predecessor leaf entry into the node
	 * containing its successor leaf entry may require a split of the node
	 * we are insert into.
	 *
	 * 2) If we find a predecessor for the predecessor entry before we
	 * reach the original node containing the entry to be deleted we break
	 * what we need to do into two operations.  First, we rebalance the
	 * tree so that the predecessor entry of the entry to be deleted is no

	 * deletion of the entry to a case we have already solved as we can now
	 * simply remove the predecessor entry from its node and use it to
	 * replace the entry to be deleted.  Thus, second, we use the already
	 * existing code to do a simple replace.  Should that fail it does not
	 * matter as we are leaving a fully consistent B+tree tree behind.
	 * Breaking this case up into two means we incur a little bit of
	 * overhead for the extra locking of the predecessor node and for the
	 * extra memmove()s and memcpy() of the predecessor entry.  But this
	 * simplifies error handling and makes the code so much simpler that it
	 * is definitely worth paying the price in overhead.
	 *
	 * Enough discussion, time to do it.  Start by going up the tree
	 * looking for a non-empty node or the original node containing the

	 * need to consider:
	 *
	 * 1) If the parent entry is not the end entry of its index node then
	 *    simply insert our parent entry at the front of the leaf node on
	 *    our right, i.e. the child node of the entry following our parent
	 *    entry.  Then remove our parent entry from our parent node and
	 *    free the leaf node the entry to be deleted is in (thus deleting
	 *    the entry).
	 *
	 *    What the above describes is effectively merging the leaf node
	 *    containing the entry to be deleted with its right-hand sibling
	 *    leaf node and in the process pulling down our parent entry into
	 *    the merged node and placing it in front of its successor entry.
	 *
	 *    Our parent node is of course turned from an index node entry to a
	 *    leaf entry as it is pulled down.
	 *
	 *    Note how if our parent entry is the only entry other than the end
	 *    entry in its node this results in our parent node being empty,
	 *    i.e. containing only the end entry.  This is fine for NTFS
	 *    B+trees, i.e. index nodes may be empty.  It is only leaf nodes
	 *    that may not be empty.
	 *
	 * 2) As point 1) above but the parent entry of the entry to be removed
	 *    does not fit in the leaf node containing its successor thus that
	 *    node needs to be split and the split may need to propagate up the
	 *    tree which is of course the job of ntfs_index_entry_add().
	 *
	 * 3) If the parent entry is the end entry of its index node, i.e.
	 *    there is no right-hand sibling leaf node then simply insert the
	 *    entry on the left of our parent entry at the end of its own child
	 *    node, i.e. the leaf node on our left.  Then remove the entry on
	 *    the left of our parent entry that we inserted into its child node
	 *    from our parent node and change the VCN sub-node pointer of our
	 *    parent node to point to our left-hand sibling.  Finally free the
	 *    leaf node the entry to be deleted is in which is no longer
	 *    referenced from anywhere (thus deleting the entry).
	 *
	 *    What the above describes is effectively merging the leaf node
	 *    containing the entry to be deleted with its left-hand sibling
	 *    leaf node and in the process pulling down the entry on the
	 *    left-hand side of our parent into the merged node and placing it
	 *    after its predecessor entry.
	 *
	 *    The left-hand sibling of our parent node is of course turned from
	 *    and index node entry to a leaf entry as it is pulled down.
	 *
	 *    Note how if the left-hand sibling of our parent entry is the only
	 *    entry other than the end entry, which is also our parent entry,
	 *    in its node this results in our parent node being empty, i.e.
	 *    containing only the end entry.  This is fine for NTFS B+trees,
	 *    i.e. index nodes may be empty.  It is only leaf nodes that may
	 *    not be empty.
	 *
	 * 4) As point 3) above but the left-hand sibling of the parent entry
	 *    of the entry to be removed does not fit in the leaf node
	 *    containing its predecessor thus that node needs to be split and
	 *    the split may need to propagate up the tree which is of course
	 *    the job of ntfs_index_entry_add().
	 *
	 * 5) If the parent entry is the end entry of its index node, i.e.
	 *    there is no right-hand sibling leaf node, and there is no entry
	 *    on the left of our parent entry, i.e. there is no left-hand
	 *    sibling leaf node, i.e. the parent node is completely empty, we
	 *    cannot merge with a sibling as there is none thus we need to
	 *    record the current state and repeat a very similar procedure as
	 *    above points 1-4 except applied to the parent node which is not
	 *    a leaf node so we need to be careful with VCN sub-node pointers.
	 *    The aim of doing this is to merge the parent node with one of its
	 *    siblings so that it is no longer empty so that our leaf node
	 *    containing the entry to be deleted has at least one sibling so
	 *    that we can merge the leaf node with one of its siblings.  If the
	 *    parent node of the parent node has no siblings either we need to
	 *    push the recorded state down into the stack of recorded states,
	 *    record the new current state, and then go to the next parent and
	 *    try to merge that with its sibling and so on until we find a
	 *    parent with a sibling that can be merged.  There are two possible
	 *    outcomes (not counting errors):
	 *    a) The going up and merging will eventually succeed in which case
	 *       we go backwards through the stack of recorded states merging
	 *       nodes as we go along until we reach the last recorded state at
	 *       which point we have reduced the problem to one of the above
	 *       points 1-4 thus we repeat them to finish.
	 *    b) We reach the index root which by definition cannot have any
	 *       siblings.  Also because we reached the index root it means
	 *       that the index root must be empty and the end entry is
	 *       pointing to the VCN sub-node we came from and because the
	 *       entry to be deleted is the last entry in its leaf-node and all
	 *       parent nodes including the index root are empty the entry to
	 *       be deleted is the very last entry of the directory thus it can
	 *       simply be removed by truncating the index allocation attribute
	 *       to zero size and if the index bitmap is non-resident
	 *       truncating it to zero size, too, and if the index bitmap is
	 *       resident zeroing its contents instead of truncating it and
	 *       finally the index root is switched to be a small index, which
	 *       is reflected in its index flags and in the removal of the VCN
	 *       sub-node pointer in the end entry of the index root.
	 *   NOTE: Instead of recursing, we do it in one go by simply freeing
	 *   all the index node blocks in the tree path until we find a
	 *   non-empty node, i.e. a node that can be merged, and we then
	 *   perform the merge by pulling down the appropriate index entry but
	 *   instead of pulling it down one level we pull it down to before its
	 *   successor (if merging to the right) or to after its predecessor (if
	 *   merging on the left) which by definition will be in a leaf node.
	 *   That give the same results as the recursion but it is much less
	 *   work to do and it affects less index nodes.
	 *   NOTE2: After implementing NOTE above, we ditch the code handling
	 *   cases 1-4 above as they are just special cases of case 5 when
	 *   implemented like NOTE.
	 *
	 * That is quite enough description now, let the games begin.  First,
	 * investigate the parent index entry of the leaf entry to be deleted
	 * to see whether it is the end entry or not to determine which of the
